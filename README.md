Recipe Website
This project is a simple recipe website created as part of my journey to learn web development. It demonstrates the foundational skills of structuring web pages using HTML. The website consists of a homepage that links to three individual recipe pages, each of which includes:

1. A picture of the dish.
2. A brief description of the recipe.
3. A list of ingredients required.
4. Step-by-step instructions to prepare the dish.
Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I have demonstrated the ability to:

1. Create and structure basic web pages using HTML.
2. Use internal linking to navigate between pages.
3. Implement semantic HTML to create meaningful and organized content.
4. Build a multi-page static website.
Project Highlights
1. Homepage: Serves as a central hub linking to individual recipe pages.
2. Recipe Pages: Contain detailed information about each dish, presented in an easy-to-read layout.
3. Clean Code: Follows best practices for writing HTML.
Future Improvements
In the future, I plan to enhance this project by:

1. Adding CSS to improve the visual design of the website.
2. Making the website responsive for better usability on different devices.
3. Including JavaScript to add interactivity, such as form validations or dynamic content.
Feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements!
